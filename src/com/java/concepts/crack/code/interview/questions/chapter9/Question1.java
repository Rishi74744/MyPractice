/**
 * Question : 1 ---> Stock Data: Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called
 * by up to 1,000 client applications to get simple end-of-day stock price
 * information (open, close, high, low). You may assume that you already have
 * the data, and you can store it in any format you wish. How would you design
 * the client-facing service that provides the information to client
 * applications? You are responsible for the development, rollout, and ongoing
 * monitoring and maintenance of the feed. Describe the different methods you
 * considered and why you would recommend your approach. Your service can use
 * any technologies you wish, and can distribute the information to the client
 * applications in any mechanism you choose.
